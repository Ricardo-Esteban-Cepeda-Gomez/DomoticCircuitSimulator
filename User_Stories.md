# User Stories — Domotic Circuit Simulator

This document describes the user stories that define the expected functionality
of the domotic circuit simulator.

## User Story 1: Add components 

As a user,
I want to add components like switches, lights, sensors, and relays to the workspace,
So that I can build my own home automation circuit visually.

### Acceptance Criteria:

- The interface shows buttons to add each component.
- Each added component appears on the canvas with an icon or label.
- The user can move or arrange the components visually.

## User Story 2: Conect Components

As a user,
I want to connect the components by linking their terminals,
So that the simulator can simulate the flow of current or signals between them.

### Acceptance Criteria:

- The interface allows selecting two components and connecting them.
- The connection is represented visually (e.g., a line).
- The system stores the relationships internally (e.g., Switch → Light).
## User Story 3: Simulate the Circuit

As a user, 
I want to be able to simulate the circuit with my parameters,
So that I can test the circuit without using real component.
